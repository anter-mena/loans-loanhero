      question: "Will applying hurt my credit score?",

        "Pre-qualification uses a soft pull that never affects your credit. Only a formal application and acceptance of a firm offer triggers a hard inquiry, which may cause a small, temporary dip.",

      question: `Can I pay back $${amount} early without penalty?`,

    {
      question: `What's the difference between a $${amount} personal loan and a payday loan?`,
      answer: `A personal loan is repaid in installments over months at a rate capped by law at ${CRIMINAL_RATE_APR}% APR, while a payday loan is due in full on your next payday and can carry an effective APR well over 300% once annualized.`,

      question: `How quickly can I get a $${amount} loan?`,

    },
    {
      question: `What are the requirements for a $${amount} loan?`,
      answer:
        "You'll need to be of legal age in your province, a Canadian resident with a valid ID, have an active bank account, and show verifiable income. Most lenders don't require perfect credit.",
    },
    {
      question: `Can I get a $${amount} loan with bad credit?`,
      answer:
        "Yes. Several Canadian lenders specialize in smaller loans for borrowers with less-than-perfect credit, though your APR will typically land at the higher end of the legal range.",

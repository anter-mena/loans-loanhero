      "Canadians can access various types of personal loans including emergency loans for unexpected expenses, debt consolidation loans to combine multiple debts, bad credit loans for those with lower credit scores, and loans tailored for gig and self-employed workers.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which type of loan is best for me?",
    answer:
      "The best loan type depends on your situation. If you need funds quickly, consider emergency or same-day loans. If you have multiple debts, a debt consolidation loan can simplify payments. If your credit isn't perfect, bad credit loans are designed for you.",

    question: "Can I get a personal loan with bad credit in Canada?",
    answer:
      "Yes! Bad credit loans are specifically designed for Canadians with less-than-perfect credit. Many lenders in our network specialize in helping borrowers who've been turned down elsewhere.",

    question: "How fast can I get approved for a loan?",

    question: "What's the difference between a payday loan and a personal loan?",
    answer:
      "Personal loans typically have longer repayment terms (months to years), lower interest rates, and larger loan amounts. Payday alternative loans offer a middle ground with more flexible terms than traditional payday loans.",
